Solar Radiation Data Analysis

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar radiation data from three different countries. The goal is to clean, visualize, and compare the data to identify patterns and trends.

Project Overview
The project involves:

- Inspecting and cleaning solar radiation data from three countries.
- Performing individual and comparative EDA.
- Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations.
- Saving cleaned datasets for further analysis.

Data Description
Input Datasets
The project uses three CSV files of three country:

    - togo-dapaong_qc.csv 
    - sierraleone-bumbuna.csv 
    - country3.csv 
    - benin-malanville.csv

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

   https://github.com/seid2015a/solar-challenge-week1

2. Create virtual enviroment 
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows


2. Install Dependencies Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install required libraries:
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
3. Place Input Files Place the datasets (togo-dapaong_qc.csv , sierraleone-bumbuna.csv, country3.csv) in the project directory
4. Run the Analysis Execute the script:


EDA Steps
1. Individual Country Analysis
Load and inspect each dataset.
Handle missing or erroneous values.
Visualize solar radiation trends and distributions.
2. Comparative Analysis
Combine datasets for cross-country comparisons.
Visualize and compare trends, distributions, and correlations.
